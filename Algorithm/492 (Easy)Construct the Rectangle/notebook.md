## Brute-Force

Find from 1 to sqrt(n) and keep valid solution

Runtime: 4 ms, faster than 43.83% of C++ online submissions for Construct the Rectangle.

Memory Usage: 4.6 MB, less than 0.75% of C++ online submissions for Construct the Rectangle.

## Further Thinking

To do prime factorization may accelerate. However, the problem becomes a NP when it turns into a combination problem.

## Best Solution for C++
