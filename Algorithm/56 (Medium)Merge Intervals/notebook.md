# Brute-Force
Using connected components to merge.
Time Complexity: O(n2)
Space Complexity: O(n2)

# Thinking Further
Sort the list first by:1. begin position 2. end position
Sorting can ensure that a traversal of the list(a simple linear scan) can get the result.
Time complexity: O(nlogn)
Space complexity: O(n)
