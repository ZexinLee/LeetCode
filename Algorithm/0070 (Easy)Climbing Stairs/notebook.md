# Brute-force

Time complexity : O(2^n). Size of recursion tree will be 2^n.



# Thinking Further

1. #### Dynamic Programming

   dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]

   - Time complexity : O(n). Single loop up to n.
   - Space complexity : O(n). dp array of size n is used.  

2. #### Fibonacci Number

   Fib(n) = Fib(n - 1) + Fib(n - 2)
