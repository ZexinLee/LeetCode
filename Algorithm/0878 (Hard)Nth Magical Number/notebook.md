# Math
Find Gcd, then can get count by Gcd.
Then use Brute-Force to find the remainder.
Time COmplexity: O(A+B)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Runtime: 4 ms, faster than 100.00% of C++ online submissions for Nth Magical Number.
Memory Usage: 8.4 MB, less than 100.00% of C++ online submissions for Nth Magical Number.

# Thinking Further
It can also be solved by binary search.
Time Complexity: O(log(Nmax(A,B)))
Space Complexity: O(1)
