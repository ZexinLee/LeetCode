# Brute-Force
Use hashmap to store the count of each character.
Time Complexity: O(N)
Space COmplexity: O(1)

Runtime: 8 ms, faster than 100.00% of C++ online submissions for String Compression.
Memory Usage: 9.2 MB, less than 100.00% of C++ online submissions for String Compression.

# Thinking Further
Also, a worse method is sort and count by order.
Time complexity: O(nlogn)
Space complexity: O(nlogn)
