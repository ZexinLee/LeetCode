Note:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
# Brute-Force
Simply do pop and insert k time.
Time complexity: O(K)
Space complexiy: O(1)

# Write temp
Write temp array, quicker than brute-force.
Time complexity: O(K)
Space complexity: O(K)

# Two pointer

# Use std::rotate

# Best-Aproach
3 reverse. It is really a good idea.
Use least memory.
