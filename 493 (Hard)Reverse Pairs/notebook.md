# Thinking

## Brute-Force

Use 2 pointers to traverse the vector

​	time complexity O(n^2)

​	space complexity O(1)

Unfortunately, I got a TLE on the platform by brute-force.

## Further Thinking

1.Linear DP does not work in this case

2.Binary Search Tree is a good way to accelerate, but still TLE（BST reduce to linear array in the worst case）

​	time complexity O(n^2)

​	space complexity O(1)

3.Modified BIT algorithm can be accepted in this question
