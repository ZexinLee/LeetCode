# Thinking

## Brute-Force

Simply use a sort algorithm with time complexity of O(nlogn) --> I wrote only a line to AC by python



However, **rewrite cmp function** in C++ are very slow(maybe there's something wrong)



Runtime: 1720 ms, faster than 2.59% of C++ online submissions for K Closest Points to Origin.

Memory Usage: 314.6 MB, less than 0.77% of C++ online submissions for K Closest Points to Origin.



## Best Solution for C++

Even use map to index the distance(optimize2.cpp) is quicker than rewrite cmp function.

## Question

Why rewrite cmp function** in C++ are very slow??? --> confused
